# 🛰️ Block-Based Registration (BBR) for Multispectral Imagery

This repository contains code and Jupyter notebooks for performing block-based registration (BBR)
on multispectral image (MSI) stacks. The workflow simulates translations/rotations and then
corrects them using SIFT-based feature extraction, GPU-accelerated RANSAC, and affine transforms.
